# The Lost Passage
The project is developed as part of the BeFantastic Together residency from August-November, 2021. The theme of the residency revolved around Climate Change and Machine Learning. We used technologies like 3D modelling, GauGan, React.js, and Three.js to digitally resurrect an extinct species called Passenger Pigeon. The final work is an interactive website where the audience is dropped into a flock of artificial pigeons that are stuck within an aesthetic box.
