# The Lost Passage
From August to November 2021, Amay Kataria was an Art & Technology fellow for a collaborative residency organized by [BeFantastic](https://befantastic.in/). The theme of the residency revolved around Climate Change and Machine Learning and was divided into three phases: BF CoLab (primer in latest artistic tools in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning), BF Dialog (a collaboration with artist mentors to develop a new project), and BF Showcase (an online exhibition of a final project). For the final project, Amay Kataria led the concept, software architecture, and creative direction of [The Lost Passage](https://amaykataria.com/#/lostpassage) and presented it as part of the BF Showcase. 

[The Lost Passage](https://thelostpassage.art) is a digitally reconstructed environment of a swarm of artificial passenger pigeons, which went extinct in the early 20th century. As a sociable flock, they once grew to a population of over 5 billion in the 1800s before going into extinction within four decades due to human intervention. In their new digital home, they inhabit a never-ending, sublime, yet destitute memory of a lost landscape. However, on closer inspection they are actually confined within the four walls of this space. The Lost Passage reflects upon the historical moment of the Passenger Pigeonâ€™s holocene extinction by using artificial intelligence and machine learning to resurrect a memory of a lost passage, thus evoking a sense of being trapped and confined through the sublime imagery.
